Inpatient treatment is more intensive, typically lasting 28 to 30 days. Outpatient treatment is less intensive, and can last anywhere from nine to 12 weeks. </p>

Some people might do well in an outpatient setting while others might need more intensive care in an inpatient setting. It’s important to consult with a professional who can help you find the right type of treatment for you.</p>

<h1 id="Should-I-Seek-Inpatient-or-Outpatient-Treatment-for-My-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Should-I-Seek-Inpatient-or-Outpatient-Treatment-for-My-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Should I Seek Inpatient or Outpatient Treatment for My Gambling Addiction?"></a>Should I Seek Inpatient or Outpatient Treatment for My Gambling Addiction?</h1><p>There are a few things to consider when it comes to deciding whether or not to seek inpatient or outpatient treatment for your gambling addiction. The first is severity of the addiction – how much control do you have over your gambling behavior, and how much does it interfere with your life? If you are unable to stop gambling even when it causes negative consequences in your life, inpatient treatment may be necessary. Another thing to consider is your support system – do you have people who can help you stick to a treatment plan outside of a clinical setting? If not, inpatient treatment may be the better option. Finally, think about your financial situation – can you afford outpatient treatment? Inpatient treatment is often more expensive, but may be necessary if your addiction is severe.</p>
<p>The best way to decide which type of treatment is right for you is to speak with a professional. They can assess your situation and recommend the most appropriate course of action.</p>
