            <h1 id="Cowboys-Explore-Surrender-Option-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Cowboys-Explore-Surrender-Option-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Cowboys Explore Surrender Option in Blackjack"></a>Cowboys Explore Surrender Option in Blackjack</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, the Dallas Cowboys are exploring the option of surrendering in Blackjack. This comes after a season where the team was expected to compete for the Super Bowl but instead finished with one of their worst records in recent memory. “We just aren’t getting the results we want,” said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. “Our players are good, but they’re just not good enough.”</p>
<p>Jones said that the team is considering all options, including surrendering, in order to improve their future prospects. “Some people may think this is a sign of weakness, but I see it as a sign of strength,” he said. “We’re not content with our current situation and we’re doing everything we can to get better.”</p>
<p>Cowboys fans have mixed reactions to the news. Some say that it’s a sign of desperation while others believe that this could be the turning point the team needs to get back on track. No matter what side of the debate you fall on, it’s clear that something needs to change in Dallas and surrendering may be their best option.</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Cowboys-Consider-Surrender-Option"><a href="#Dallas-Cowboys-Consider-Surrender-Option" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Cowboys Consider Surrender Option"></a>Dallas Cowboys Consider Surrender Option</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys have a lot of work to do this offseason if they want to bounce back from their disappointing 2017-2018 season. One big decision they face is whether or not to trade star running back Ezekiel Elliott.</p>
<p>Elliott had yet another great season on the field, rushing for over 1,200 yards and scoring 10 touchdowns. However, he also found himself in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. He was involved in several off-field incidents, including a domestic violence case that is still pending.</p>
<p>Team owner Jerry Jones has said that he is not considering trading Elliott at this point, but league sources say that the Cowboys are considering all options, including trading their star running back. If they do decide to trade him, they would likely want a first round draft pick in return.</p>
<p>There are several teams that could use a running back like Elliott, including the New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers, and Philadelphia Eagles. The Giants could be a possible trade partner for the Cowboys, as they have the No. 2 overall pick in this year’s NFL draft and are looking for a new running back after letting go of veteran rusher Orleans Darkwa.</p>
<p>The 49ers could also use a running back after letting go of Carlos Hyde and electing not to re-sign veteran Alfred Morris. They have the No. 9 overall pick in this year’s draft and could use it to acquire Elliott from the Cowboys.</p>
<p>The Eagles could also be a potential trade partner for Elliott. They lost starting running back Jay Ajayi to injury late in the season and could use another powerful runner like Elliott to help them make another run at the Super Bowl.</p>
<h1 id="Cowboys-Weigh-Surrendering-Early-in-Blackjack-Games"><a href="#Cowboys-Weigh-Surrendering-Early-in-Blackjack-Games" class="headerlink" title="Cowboys Weigh Surrendering Early in Blackjack Games"></a>Cowboys Weigh Surrendering Early in Blackjack Games</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys have been the laughing stock of the NFL for the last few years. They seem to be always on the brink of making a comeback, but they always seem to find a new way to screw it up in the end. This year, many experts are picking them to make a run at the Super Bowl. However, there is one thing that could hold them back – their propensity to surrender early in blackjack games.</p>
<p>In blackjack, players can choose to either hit or stand on their hand. If they hit, they draw another card and add its value to their hand total. If they stand, they keep their current total and do not receive any additional cards. When players have a total of 16 or lower, they have the option of surrendering – folding their hand and losing half of their bet.</p>
<p>The Cowboys seem to love surrendering early in blackjack games. In fact, they have surrendered on more than 60% of all hands when playing with a 16 or lower total. This means that they are giving up a lot of potential winning hands and costing themselves valuable points.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some situations where surrendering is the right move. For example, if the dealer has a high card (Ace or 10) showing, then it may be wise to surrender rather than risk going bust. However, if the dealer has a low card showing (2 through 6), then you should usually hit rather than surrender.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Cowboys need to start standing on more hands if they want to make a run at the Super Bowl this year. Surrendering early in blackjack games is simply not going to cut it against some of the top teams in the league.</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Cowboys-Mull-Surrender-Option-for-Blackjack-Play"><a href="#Dallas-Cowboys-Mull-Surrender-Option-for-Blackjack-Play" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Cowboys Mull Surrender Option for Blackjack Play"></a>Dallas Cowboys Mull Surrender Option for Blackjack Play</h1><p>The Dallas Cowboys are still in the thick of the playoff hunt, but they might want to consider conceding to save their season.</p>
<p>The Cowboys (7-6) have lost six of their last eight games and are now fighting for a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. mathematically speaking, they have a 44 percent chance of making the postseason, according to FiveThirtyEight.</p>
<p>Dallas’ recent skid has coincided with Ezekiel Elliott’s return from suspension. The running back has averaged just 3 yards per carry in his last two games and theCowboys have averaged just 15 points per game in that span.</p>
<p>Considering the team’s struggles and the looming possibility of another Elliott suspension, it might make more sense for Dallas to concede the season and focus on next year.</p>
<p>This isn’t uncharted territory for NFL teams. In fact, three teams – the 2001 Carolina Panthers, 2004 Buffalo Bills and 2008 Miami Dolphins – have previously made the playoffs after starting 0-3.</p>
<p>However, those teams all had winning records down the stretch and made it into the postseason by way of tiebreakers. The Cowboys almost certainly would not be able to replicate that feat this year.</p>
<p>If Dallas decides to concede, they can still salvage something from this season. The team could use its remaining games as an opportunity to evaluate players who may not be part of their long-term plans. Dak Prescott, Elliot and Amari Cooper are all slated to become free agents after next season and it would behoove Dallas to get a better idea of whether they want to re-sign them or not.</p>
<p>Conceding also gives head coach Jason Garrett some much-needed job security. He is on the hot seat after a disappointing season and could use a late-season turnaround to keep his job for 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-Dallas-Cowboys-Surrender-Option-a-Good-Strategy"><a href="#Is-the-Dallas-Cowboys-Surrender-Option-a-Good-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Is the Dallas Cowboys Surrender Option a Good Strategy?"></a>Is the Dallas Cowboys Surrender Option a Good Strategy?</h1><p>When the Dallas Cowboys lost to the Tennessee Titans in Week 6, they were 3-2 and still in first place in the NFC East. But that Week 7 loss to the Washington Redskins started a six-game losing streak that resulted in the Cowboys being eliminated from playoff contention.</p>
<p>Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is known for being a big spender in free agency, but this offseason he has been more frugal than usual. He let defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence and wide receiver Allen Hurns leave in free agency, and he didn’t make a big trade for cornerback Jalen Ramsey.</p>
<p>Now with the Cowboys at 6-9, some fans are wondering if Jones should surrender and start rebuilding for next season.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why surrendering might not be a good strategy for the Cowboys. First, they are still in first place in their division. If they can win their last two games they will win the division and host a playoff game.</p>
<p>Second, there are several good young players on the team who could improve with another year of experience. Quarterback Dak Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliott, and linebacker Leighton Vander Esch all showed promise this season and could be even better next year.</p>
<p>Third, Jones is known for being a great GM and he has usually been successful in building championship teams. It would be foolish to give up on his team just because they had a bad season this year.</p>
<p>The Cowboys may not be playoff contenders next year, but they still have a lot of talent and can be competitive if Jones makes the right moves this offseason. Surrendering now would be premature and could set the team back for years to come.</p>
