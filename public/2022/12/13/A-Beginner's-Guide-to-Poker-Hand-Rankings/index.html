This ranking is what decides who wins and loses the pot when two or more players have equally ranked hands. The rank of a hand is determined by the rank of its highest card — also called the “top card” or “kicker.”</p>
<p>This guide will teach you about the different hand rankings in poker and how to use them to your advantage.</p>
<p>The most basic poker hand is the five-card flush. This is any five cards of the same suit, regardless of their rank. The next strongest hand is five consecutive cards of any suit, such as 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥ (aka a “straight flush”). After that comes four of a kind, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and high card (no pairs).</p>
<p>Aces are high and kings are low in poker. So an ace-high straight (A♠ 2♦ 3♣ 4♣ 5♦) would beat a king-high straight (K♠ Q♦ J♠ 10♦ 9♣), for example.</p>
<p>If two players have no pairs and identical high cards, then the player with the next highest card wins. For example, if two players have an ace-high Straight (A♥ 2♦ 3♥ 4♦ 5♥), the player with the 3♥ would win over the player with the A♥. If both players had 3s, then it would go to the second highest card (the 2 in this example) and so on. In cases where both players have identical high cards and all other cards match as well, then it’s a tie and both players split the pot.</p>
<h1 id="The-Ins-and-Outs-of-Poker-Hand-Rankings"><a href="#The-Ins-and-Outs-of-Poker-Hand-Rankings" class="headerlink" title="The Ins and Outs of Poker Hand Rankings"></a>The Ins and Outs of Poker Hand Rankings</h1><p>When it comes to playing poker, you need to know the ranking of hands in order to make the best decisions while in a hand. The better your hand, the more likely you are to win. Here is a rundown of the rankings, from weakest to strongest:</p>
<ol>
<li>High card</li>
<li>Pair</li>
<li>Two pair</li>
<li>Three of a kind</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Full house</li>
<li>Four of a kind</li>
<li>Straight flush</li>
<li>Royal flush</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-Figure-Out-Which-Hands-are-Ranked-the-Best-in-Poker"><a href="#How-to-Figure-Out-Which-Hands-are-Ranked-the-Best-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="How to Figure Out Which Hands are Ranked the Best in Poker"></a>How to Figure Out Which Hands are Ranked the Best in Poker</h1><p>Poker is a game that is all about making the best hand possible. In order to do this, you need to know which hands are the best.</p>
<p>There are many different hand rankings in poker, but some hands are definitely better than others. Here is a look at the top five hands in poker, starting with the best hand possible:</p>
<p>#1 – Royal Flush<br>A royal flush is the best hand in poker. This is a flush that contains an ace, king, queen, jack and 10 of the same suit. If you are able to make this hand, you will automatically win the game.</p>
<p>#2 – Straight Flush<br>A straight flush is next on the list, and it is also a very strong hand. This is a five card sequence in the same suit, such as 9-8-7-6-5. As long as all of your cards are of the same suit, you will have a straight flush.</p>
<p>#3 – Four of a Kind<br>If you get four of a kind, you have a very strong hand. This means that you have four cards of the same rank, such as four kings or four queens. As long as one of your other cards is not a duplicate, you will have four of a kind.</p>
<p>#4 – Full House<br>A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three sixes and two jacks. This is a very strong hand and it beats most other hands in poker.</p>
<p>#5 – Flush<br>A flush is made up of five cards that are all part of the same suit, such as 5-3-2-Ace-King. This hand can be any rank, but it must be all one suit.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Poker-Hand-Rankings"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Poker-Hand-Rankings" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About Poker Hand Rankings"></a>What You Need to Know About Poker Hand Rankings</h1><p>In poker, the strength of one’s hand is paramount in order to win the pot. The hand rankings system is based on five card hands. In descending order, the best poker hands are: Straight flush, Four of a kind, Full house, Flush, Straight, Three of a kind, Two pair and Ace high. </p>
<p>The following is a list of all thirteen hands in order from strongest to weakest:</p>
<p>Straight flush<br>Four of a kind<br>Full house<br>Flush<br>Straight<br>Three of a kind<br>Two pair<br>Ace high 
                               </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Straight flush - A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. The ace can be either high or low for this hand ranking. For example, 3♣ 4♦ 5♥ 6♠ would be an eight-high straight flush. This is the best possible hand in poker and can beat any other combination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four of a kind - As the name suggests, four cards of the same rank make up this hand. If two players have four of a kind, the rank of the four cards will determine the winner - so two aces will beat two kings. If there is no clear winner, then the pot is split equally between both players.
            </p>
</li>
<li><p>Full house - A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank e.g. 8♥ 8♦ 2♥ 2♦ making it an eight-full house). This hand beats both a straight and three of a kind and if two players have full houses, the rank of higher set wins (so 7♦ 7♣ 4♥ 4♦ would beat 3♦ 3♠ K♠ K♥). If there is no clear winner, then the pot is split equally between both players.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>                      </p>
<p>4 Flush - A flush consists simply five cards all of the same suit e.g 5♣ 7♣ 9♣ J♦ would be ace-high flush (and would beat any other combination that isn’t itself a flush). This hand usually ranks above a straight but below a full house or four of a kind (depending on the rank of the four-of-a-kind).<br>               ———-</p>
<p>5 Straight - A straight is five consecutive cards not all belonging to the same suit e.g Q♥ J♠ 10♥ 9♦ would be king-high straight). This hand usually ranks above both flushes and three of a kinds but below full houses or foursomes (again depending on rank). Like with flushes though, straights vary in value depending on which suits they contain so for instance 10♣ J♦ Q♦ K♣ would be lower than 10♥ J♠ Q♥K♦</p>
<h1 id="Understanding-Poker-Hand-Rankings"><a href="#Understanding-Poker-Hand-Rankings" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Poker Hand Rankings"></a>Understanding Poker Hand Rankings</h1><p>In poker, players are dealt a hand of five cards. The rank of the card is what decides how strong your hand is. In most variants, the rank of the cards is as follows:</p>
<p>A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2</p>
<p>The Ace can be either high (above the King) or low (below the 2) and is the most powerful card in the deck. In contrast, the 2 is the weakest card.</p>
<p>There are 13 different combinations that can be made with five cards and these are called “hands”. They’re ranked in order from strongest to weakest as follows:</p>
<p>Royal flush – A royal flush is made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the same suit. It’s the strongest possible hand and cannot be beaten.</p>
<p>Straight flush – A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. For example 8♥ 9♥ 10♥ J♥ Q♥ would be a straight flush. This is next in line after a royal flush and can be beaten by only another straight flush.</p>
<p>Four of a kind – Four of a kind are four cards of the same rank e.g 4♦ 4♠ 4♥ 4♣</p>
<p>Full house – A full house contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank e.g 3♦ 3♥ 3♣ 6♦ 6♠ . This combination can beat two pairs but can lose to a four of a kind or better.</p>
<p>Quads – Quads (quadruplets) are four cards of the same rank and different suits e.g 5♦ 5♠ 5♥ 6♦ would be quads). This combination can beat any other type of hand except for a royal flush or straight flush.</p>
<p>  Two pair – Two pair consists of two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank e.g 2♦ 2♣ 7♦ 7♠ . As you might expect this combination can also lose against hands with three-of-a-kind or better.</p>
<p>One pair – One pair simply consists of two cards with the same rank e.g 4♦ 4♣ . This hand is generally weaker than all other hands listed so far with the exception of a high card where none of these specific combinations apply</p>
