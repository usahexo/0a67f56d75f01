<p>$75 million (1874)</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer is set to be the new banker in baccarat. The move comes as Twain’s net worth surges to $75 million on the heels of a successful investment in a new gold mine. The 73-year-old author made his fortune by investing in the gold mine early on and will now take his seat at the casino tables to oversee proceedings. Baccarat is a high-stakes card game that often sees fortunes change hands in a single night. The bank has the advantage in any given hand, so it’s important for the banker to make informed decisions and maximize profits.</p>
<p> Twain is no stranger to gambling. He has been known to enjoy a game of poker or blackjack from time to time. However, baccarat is a different beast altogether. This complex game requires nerves of steel and a quick mind if you hope to come out on top. Twain is certainly up for the challenge, and with his vast wealth at his disposal, he stands a good chance of making some serious profits.</p>
<p>The news of Twain’s appointment as banker has generated a lot of interest among casino players and industry insiders alike. Some believe that he may be overmatched for the task at hand, while others are confident that he will thrive in this new role. One thing is for sure – Twain is sure to make a splash at the casino table and provide some entertainment along the way!</p>

As they played, they attracted a large crowd of onlookers. The boat’s captain happened to be walking by and noticed the commotion. He asked what was going on, and Tom explained the game to him. The captain was impressed and decided to make Tom his personal banker for the rest of the voyage.</p>
<p>Tom was a natural at banking. He quickly won back all the money that had been lost by the other passengers and then some. The captain was so impressed with Tom’s skills that he offered him a job as his personal banker when the voyage was over. Tom gladly accepted and went on to become one of the most successful bankers in the country.</p>
<p>Huck Finn was happy to be able to help his friend out, but he was also glad that he no longer had to worry about money. Life on board the Royal was now much more enjoyable for him.</p>

Clemens, a banker from San Francisco who would later become known as the famous writer, Samuel Clemens – better known as Mark Twain.</p>
<p>The two men met at a club in San Francisco and became great friends almost immediately. They would often sit up late into the night discussing politics, life, and of course literature. It was during one of these conversations that Clemens revealed his true passion – gambling.</p>
<p>Twain was fascinated by his friend’s stories of gambling in far-off places like Cuba and Nicaragua and couldn’t help but ask for advice on how to play baccarat (a popular card game of the time). Clemens took it upon himself to teach Twain everything he knew about the game and the two men would often gamble together in private games.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, it was Twain’s success as a gambler that led to Clemens’ downfall. When word got out that Twain was regularly beating all the other players at the casino, they refused to let him play anymore. This left Clemens high and dry – with no money to continue gambling with.</p>
<p>Fortunately for him, his old friend Twain came to his rescue. He offered Clemens a job as his personal banker while they continued to gamble together; ensuring that Clemens always had enough money to keep playing (and losing). Unfortunately, this arrangement didn’t last long and the two men eventually lost touch.</p>

<p>private game to be held at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco on</p>
<p>March 15th. A group of 10 players have each put up $5000 to participate</p>
<p>in the game. The minimum bet will be $100 with a maximum of $1000. Twain</p>
<p>will keep 10% of the profits and pay out the rest to the players.</p>
