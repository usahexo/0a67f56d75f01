<h1 id="How-do-you-play-Quest-To-The-West-Is-it-just-like-other-slot-games"><a href="#How-do-you-play-Quest-To-The-West-Is-it-just-like-other-slot-games" class="headerlink" title="How do you play Quest To The West? Is it just like other slot games?"></a>How do you play Quest To The West? Is it just like other slot games?</h1><p>Quest To The West is an online slot game that was created by Microgaming. It has five reels and 243 ways to win, which is different from other slot games that usually have a fixed number of paylines. The game also offers a wild symbol, a scatter symbol, and a free spins bonus game.</p>
<p>The wild symbol in Quest To The West is the gold coin. This symbol can substitute for any other symbol to create a winning combination, with the exception of the scatter symbol. The scatter symbol in this game is the wagon wheel. If three or more wagon wheel symbols appear anywhere on the reels, players will trigger the free spins bonus game. In this bonus game, players will have the opportunity to win up to 15 free spins.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-different-symbols-and-what-do-they-mean-in-the-game"><a href="#What-are-the-different-symbols-and-what-do-they-mean-in-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What are the different symbols and what do they mean in the game?"></a>What are the different symbols and what do they mean in the game?</h1><p>Each game has symbols associated with it and they all mean different things. In order to be a successful player, you need to understand what each symbol means and how it can help you.</p>
<p>The first symbol is the dollar sign. This is the most common symbol in the game and it is used to represent money. When you see this symbol, it means that you can collect the money that is displayed on the machine.</p>
<p>The second symbol is a heart. This symbol represents love and it can help you to win big rewards. When you see this symbol, make sure to keep an eye on it because it will payout big rewards when it hits the payline.</p>
<p>The third symbol is a spade. This is a very important symbol because it is used to represent the wild card. When this symbol hits the payline, it will substitute for any other symbol in order to create a winning combination.</p>
<p>The fourth symbol is a club. This is another important symbol because it represents the multiplier. When this symbol appears on the payline, it will multiply your payout by the number that is displayed on the club logo.</p>
<p>The fifth and final symbol is a diamond. This represents the scatter symbol in the game and it can award some great rewards when it hits the payline. If you see this symbol, make sure to keep an eye out for its appearance because it could lead to some big wins!</p>

What do I have to do to trigger them and what can I expect when they start?"></a>I saw that there are bonus rounds in Quest To The West. What do I have to do to trigger them and what can I expect when they start?</h1><p>The bonus rounds in Quest To The West are triggered randomly, and there’s no real way to predict when they will start. However, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of triggering them.</p>
<p>First, try to keep your horses as healthy as possible. If one of your horses dies, the bonus round will likely not trigger. Second, make sure you’re stocked up on food. Running out of food can also prevent the bonus round from starting.</p>
<p>When the bonus round starts, you’ll be presented with a series of choices. These choices will determine the outcome of the bonus round and can result in either increased rewards or extra challenges. Be sure to make wise decisions if you want to come out ahead in the bonus round!</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-other-features-in-the-game-that-I-should-know-about-before-playing"><a href="#Are-there-any-other-features-in-the-game-that-I-should-know-about-before-playing" class="headerlink" title="Are there any other features in the game that I should know about before playing?"></a>Are there any other features in the game that I should know about before playing?</h1><p>There are many other features of the game that you should be aware of before playing. One is the ability to fast-forward time. This can be useful if you want to speed up the game or if you’re waiting for something to happen. You can also pause the game by pressing the spacebar. If you want to leave your computer for a while but don’t want the game to pause automatically, you can choose to keep playing by selecting “continue playing” in the pause menu.</p>
<p>You can also choose your player’s race and class in the beginning of the game. Your race determines your starting location, character appearance, and abilities. Your class affects your abilities, equipment, and how enemies will react to you. There are six different classes and ten different races to choose from, so there is a lot of variety between characters.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that enemies can attack from behind. If you’re fighting a group of enemies, make sure to keep an eye on their movements so that you’re not flanked. Additionally, some enemies have special abilities that can easily kill your character if you’re not careful. Be sure to read each enemy’s description before attacking them so that you know what to expect.</p>
<p>Finally, always make sure to save your game frequently in case something goes wrong. The game offers three save slots, so you can save your progress at different points in the game.</p>
