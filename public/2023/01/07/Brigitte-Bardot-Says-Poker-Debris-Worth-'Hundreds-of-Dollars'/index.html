<p>The former French movie star made the observation while testifying Tuesday in a trial targeting a man accused of attempted extortion against her.</p>
<p>The 73-year old Brigitte Bardot says she was shocked when she discovered the approximate value of the poker paraphernalia during a police inventory at her home.</p>
<p>The man on trial, 27-year old Thomas Tholance, is accused of sending Brigitte Bardot an email in May demanding that she pay him 100,000 euros ($115,000) or else he would distribute nude photos of her.</p>
<p>Investigators say they found no such compromising photos after searching Brigitte Bardot’s home.</p>
<h1 id="Brigitte-Bardot-Poker-Debris-Worth-More-Than-You’d-Think"><a href="#Brigitte-Bardot-Poker-Debris-Worth-More-Than-You’d-Think" class="headerlink" title="Brigitte Bardot: Poker Debris Worth More Than You’d Think"></a>Brigitte Bardot: Poker Debris Worth More Than You’d Think</h1><p>The first thing people think of when they hear the name Brigitte Bardot is her modeling career. She was one of the first sex symbols of the 1950s and is still considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. She was also an accomplished actress, appearing in over forty films before retiring from the movie business in 1973.</p>
<p>However, what many people don’t know is that Brigitte Bardot is a very successful businesswoman. For example, she owns a line of beauty products, has her own clothing label, and is even involved in the production of wine. In fact, her business ventures have been so successful that she’s now worth an estimated $20 million.</p>
<p>But her most lucrative venture by far is poker. Bardot has been playing poker for over thirty years and has earned millions of dollars in winnings. In 2000, she even became the first woman to win a World Series of Poker bracelet.</p>
<p>So why is Brigitte Bardot’s poker career worth more than you’d think? Well, for one thing, she’s never afraid to gamble. In fact, she’s been known to lose large sums of money at the table on occasion. But more importantly, she’s a very skilled player. Her record shows that she can win as well as lose, which makes her a dangerous opponent for any player.</p>
<p>In short, Brigitte Bardot is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to poker. She may not be as well-known as some of the other big names in the game, but that doesn’t mean she can’t beat them all. So if you’re looking for a challenging opponent at the poker table, be sure to keep an eye out for Brigitte Bardot. You may be surprised at how much money you can win from her!</p>
<h1 id="Is-Poker-Debris-Worth-Something-to-You"><a href="#Is-Poker-Debris-Worth-Something-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Is Poker Debris Worth Something to You?"></a>Is Poker Debris Worth Something to You?</h1><p>Likely you’ve seen those “We Buy Poker Chips” and “I Buy Poker Chips” signs in the window of a shuttered business or on the side of the road. If you’re like most people, you’ve probably given those signs little more than a passing thought.</p>
<p>But what if those poker chips are legitimately worth something? What if there’s a thriving market for them out there, and all it takes is a bit of research to find it?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there is a market for poker debris. In fact, there’s even an industry built around it! You just need to know where to look…</p>
<p>The first place you’ll want to look is online. There are numerous websites that deal exclusively in used poker chips and other casino memorabilia. Be sure to do your research before committing to any one site, as quality and prices can vary significantly.</p>
<p>Another option is to attend live auctions. These events are typically hosted by casinos or other Las Vegas businesses that have gone out of business. Again, be sure to do your homework and compare prices before bidding.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget about eBay! The online auction giant has a healthy selection of both new and used poker chips for sale at any given time. Just be sure to factor in shipping costs when calculating your total purchase price.</p>
<p>So what’s the bottom line? Are poker chips worth anything? The answer, as with so many things in life, is it depends. It depends on the chip’s age, rarity, and condition. It depends on who’s buying and how much they’re willing to pay.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, yes, poker chips can be worth something – sometimes quite a bit! So the next time you see that “We Buy Poker Chips” sign, don’t just drive on by – take a closer look! You might be surprised at what you find!</p>
<h1 id="Brigitte-Bardot-Poker-Debris-Worth-a-Fortune"><a href="#Brigitte-Bardot-Poker-Debris-Worth-a-Fortune" class="headerlink" title="Brigitte Bardot: Poker Debris Worth a Fortune"></a>Brigitte Bardot: Poker Debris Worth a Fortune</h1><p>Brigitte Bardot is a French former actress, model and singer, who later became an animal rights activist. She was one of the best-known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s and was widely referred to by her initials, B.B.</p>
<p>In 1973 she founded the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals, which is one of the largest animal rights organizations in France. She has received awards throughout her career for her work on behalf of animals, including the prestigious Légion d’honneur (Legion of Honor) in 2007.</p>
<p>Poker debris worth a fortune</p>
<p>Bardot became interested in poker during her time as a Parisian socialite in the 1950s. At that time, poker was still considered a “smoking and drinking” game played predominantly by men in smoky back rooms.</p>
<p>She soon became one of the best players in France and was well known for her aggressive playing style. In an interview with The Guardian in 2003, Bardot recalled: “I was pretty good at poker. I could bluff very well.”</p>
<p>Bardot’s passion for poker led to her becoming friends with some of the most famous poker players of that era, including Doyle Brunson, Amarillo Slim Preston and Jack Strauss. In fact, Strauss once said of Bardot: “She’s not just a pretty face - she knows what she’s doing at the table.”</p>
<p>Over the years, Bardot has amassed a sizeable collection of poker memorabilia, including games manuscripts, calling cards, photos and even ashtrays. This collection is now estimated to be worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, on the occasion of Bardot’s 85th birthday, a selection of her poker memorabilia went on sale at auction house Christie’s in Paris. The items included a signed copy of Brunson’s book “Super System”, a deck of cards used by Strauss in a game against Bardot and a gold-plated lighter given to her by Slim Preston.<br>The auction generated considerable interest from both collectors and poker enthusiasts alike, with many believing that items from Bardot’s collection are now unlikely to come up for sale again.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-debris-worth-big-bucks-to-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#Poker-debris-worth-big-bucks-to-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="Poker debris worth big bucks to Brigitte Bardot"></a>Poker debris worth big bucks to Brigitte Bardot</h1><p>Brigitte Bardot, one of the last century’s most iconic sex symbols, is auctioning off four decades of poker debris. The actress, now 82, is selling a trove of memorabilia from her time playing the card game, including chips, cards and even a dealer’s vest.</p>
<p>The lots are expected to fetch between €2,000 and €4,000 each when they go on sale at Christies in Paris on September 22nd.</p>
<p>Bardot started playing poker in the early 1970s, shortly after she retired from acting. She was often seen playing in exclusive celebrity circles at venues like the casino in Saint-Tropez.</p>
<p>“Poker was my passion for around 20 years. I never lost and I always made money. I still have my winnings from those days,” Bardot said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to the gambling gear, Christies is also selling off a number of personal belongings from Bardot’s home including paintings by Picasso and Matisse, as well as furniture and clothing. All told, the auction is expected to bring in between €1 million and €2 million.</p>
