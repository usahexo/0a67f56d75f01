#  MLP Comic Trixie Swears Off Gambling Following Casino Game Loss

It was a dark and stormy night, and Trixie was feeling lucky. So she went to the casino to try her hand at some games of chance. She started with some simple games, but quickly moved on to the more high-stakes ones.

But luck was not on her side tonight, and she eventually lost all her money. This led to her swearing off gambling for good. She may have lost this battle, but she's determined to win the war against luck and casinos!

#  MLP Comic Trixie: I Told You Gambling Was a Bad Idea

"I told you gambling was a bad idea," Trixie said as she laid her cards on the table.

Twilight Sparkle just stared at her friend, "You said that the last time we played too."

"And I was right," Trixie smugly replied.

The two had been playing poker for hours, and Trixie had managed to win every hand. Twilight was beginning to think that her friend must have some sort of magic power when it came to poker.

"Fine," Twilight conceded, "you're a better player than me. I admit it."

"Of course I am," Trixie said with a grin. "I'm the Great and Powerful Trixie after all."

#  MLP Comic Trixie: I Was So Close to Winning

I can't believe it. I was so close to winning. I had the crowd in the palm of my hand and then, out of nowhere, Twilight Sparkle swoops in and takes the victory. How could she have done that?

It's true that I was a bit cocky going into the competition, but I really thought I had this one in the bag. After all, who knows more about magic than Trixie? But apparently, Twilight Sparkle does.

I thought for sure my trick with the disappearing raincloud would seal the deal, but she must have had something up her sleeve. That little Twilight Sparkle is something else.

Still, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. I know I should be happy for Twilight Sparkle, but I can't help feeling like I let everyone down. Especially myself.

Maybe this just wasn't my day. There will always be another opportunity to show everyone what Trixie is capable of. Next time Trixie will be sure to come out on top!

#  MLP Comic Trixie Loses Big in Casino Game

It was a sunny day in Las Vegas, Nevada. Trixie was on vacation and had decided to visit the city's world-famous casinos. She had started the day with some luck, winning several small bets at the blackjack table. But as the day went on, her luck changed. She started to lose money at every game she played.

Finally, Trixie decided to try her luck at the slot machines. She put in a few dollars and began to play. The first few spins yielded no wins, but then finally she hit the jackpot! She won $100 on her first spin!

Excited, Trixie put in more money and began to play again. But this time her luck ran out. She lost all of her winnings from the previous spin, plus another $50. Disappointed, she gathered up her things and left the casino.

#  MLP Comic Trixie: Why Did I Ever Gamble on a Casino Game?

It was about two in the morning and I was feeling a bit desperate. My last bits of money were just about gone and I needed more if I wanted to keep gambling. I had been at the casino all night and my luck was running low. I saw Trixie walking by, so I approached her and asked if she wanted to play a game. She agreed and we sat down at the table.

I thought that I could win back what I had lost and maybe even some extra cash on top of that. But, as always seems to happen at casinos, my luck ran out. Trixie won every single round and took all of my money. In hindsight, it was a really bad idea to gamble with her.

If you see Trixie at a casino, do yourself a favor and stay away from her. She is definitely not someone you want to mess with when it comes to gambling games.
