Looking for a vacation destination that offers something for everyone? Look no further than Belize. This Central American country is home to dense rain forests, coral reefs, and Mayan ruins, as well as a host of outdoor activities like snorkeling, kayaking, and zip lining. What’s more, Belize is one of the most affordable tourist destinations in the world.

Special Bonus Stop: If you’re looking to add an extra layer of excitement to your vacation, consider booking a trip to Playa del Carmen. Just south of Cancun on the Yucatan Peninsula, Playa del Carmen is a popular beach town with plenty of restaurants, bars, and clubs to keep you entertained. The best part? Traveling between Belize and Playa del Carmen is easy and affordable thanks to regular flights from both countries.

How to Get There: Most visitors arrive in Belize via Belize City International Airport (BZE). From there, it’s easy to catch a connecting flight or bus to one of the major tourist destinations like Ambergris Caye or Placencia. If you’re headed to Playa del Carmen, your best bet is fly into Cancun International Airport (CUN) and take the short drive down the coast.

When to Go: The high season in Belize runs from November through May when temperatures are balmy and Humidity is low. If you’re looking for some peace and quiet, consider visiting in the off-season when prices are lower and crowds are thinner. That said, hurricane season runs from June through November so be sure to check the weather forecast before planning your trip.

What to Bring: Be sure to pack light when traveling to Belize – most resorts have laundry facilities on site so you can easily wash clothes as needed. You’ll also want to bring swimsuit(s), sunscreen, insect repellent, hats/sunglasses, sturdy shoes, and a good camera!

Money Matters: The official currency in Belize is theBelizean dollar (BZD). As of writing this article, $1 US Dollar = 2 BZD. Keep in mind that many businesses – especially those near tourist areas – accept US dollars as well. When converting funds be sure to ask your bank about service fees – they can be high so it’s always best to have some local currency on hand just in case.
