#  10CRIC – The Fastest and Most Exciting Casino Game Around!

10CRIC is quickly becoming the most popular casino game in the world. It is simple to understand and insanely fast-paced, providing players with a thrill like no other game can.

How to Play 10CRIC

The aim of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible by rotating the dial and landing on numbers 1 through 10. The first player to reach 100 points or more wins the round. There are different ways to score points:

1 Point – Landing on any number between 1 and 10

3 Points – Landing on a triple (i.e. three consecutive numbers, such as 1-2-3)

5 Points – Landing on a corner (i.e. four consecutive numbers in a square pattern)

10 Points – Landing on a double or triple of the same number (e.g. landing on 12 twice in one turn will give you 20 points)

If you are able to achieve any of the above feats, you must spin again and continue accumulating points until you either reach 100 or lose your turn. If you reach 100 points or more, you immediately win the round! However, if you land on ‘0’, your opponent automatically wins regardless of their score.
