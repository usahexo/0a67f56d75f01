#  Movie Lover Misses Wedding Casino with Dice

A young woman from the Midwest, in her early twenties, had to make a quick decision to travel out of state for an important job interview or attend her long-awaited best friend’s wedding. She decided on the job interview and called to say she couldn’t make it to the wedding. Her friends were understanding and said they would keep her seat at the head table reserved with a place card.

The young woman was thrilled with her decision because she got the job! But when she called her friends back to apologize for not being able to make it to the wedding, they told her they canceled the wedding because no one else could be found to take her place. They had a good laugh about it and wished her well.

She was so upset that she missed out on what would have been a fun weekend with friends. She wishes now that she would have taken the gamble and gone to the casino with dice!

#  Couple's Quarrel over Missing Wedding Casino with Dice

___

When Rachel and John's wedding planner forwarded them the final invoice for their big day, they were shocked to find a $500 charge for casino with dice. Rachel immediately called her fiancé John, who was equally surprised and disbelief. They both had a clear memory of saying that they didn't want any gaming tables at their wedding. How could this happen? They must have been overlooked in the planning process.

After some heated discussion, they decided to call the wedding planner to get clarification. Unfortunately, the planner had since left the company and none of the other staff could remember anything about a casino with dice. With no other evidence to support their case, Rachel and John reluctantly paid the bill.

Months later, when they were going through their wedding photos, they came across a picture of their reception that clearly showed a blackjack table amongst the other decorations. They were dumbfounded; how could they have missed seeing this during their walk-through? It looked like the table was even set up next to where they would've been sitting!

They quickly put two and two together and realized that their wedding planner must have misunderstood when they said "no gaming tables." In her defense, it was a busy time and she might not have heard them properly over all the wedding planning commotion. They felt silly for getting into such a big argument over something that was ultimately just an honest mistake.

If you're planning your wedding, be sure to communicate clearly with your vendors about your expectations. That way, there won't be any misunderstandings on the big day!

#  Groom Left at Altar as Bride Goes Missing from Wedding Casino with Dice 

The bride, 30, and groom, 31, had planned a lovely destination wedding at a casino in Pahrump, Nevada. But when the big day arrived, things quickly went awry. The bride was nowhere to be found when it came time for the ceremony, and the groom had mysteriously disappeared – leaving only his abandoned suit and tie as clues at the altar.

Local law enforcement officials have launched an investigation into what could have happened to the missing couple, but so far no clues have been revealed as to their whereabouts. Some theories being floated around include that the two ran off together or that they were victims of foul play.

The bride’s family has been left devastated by the turn of events. Her aunt told reporters, “We just don’t know what could have happened. We’re all so worried about her and her husband. They were supposed to be getting married today!”

In the meantime, wedding guests are trying to make sense of what could have gone wrong. One guest said, “It was just such a surreal scene. The groom was standing there all alone at the altar and the bride was nowhere to be found. It was like something out of a movie.”

Hopefully this mystery will be solved soon so that everyone involved can get some answers. In the meantime, we can only speculate as to what may have happened to the missing couple.
