#  Bingo Brawl: 10 injured in monopoly-themed game gone wrong 

Ten people were injured in a bingo brawl at a senior living center in Arkansas last week. 

The fight began when two women objected to a man marking bingo cards for two other players. The altercation escalated and quickly turned into a free-for-all, with players punching, clawing, and pulling each other's hair. 

"It was like something out of a movie," said one eyewitness. "People were screaming and cursing, and chairs were flying everywhere." 

Ten people were injured in the melee, including four who had to be hospitalized. One woman suffered a broken jaw, while another had her nose fractured. 

Police are still investigating the incident, but no arrests have been made.

#  Woman wins $1,000 playing monopoly boardwalk bingo  
When Brenda Jackson of Urbana, Ohio won a $1,000 prize playing the boardwalk bingo game on her Monopoly board, she was as surprised as anyone.
"I was on my way to the casino with my husband and I saw the game at Toys 'R Us," Jackson told lottery officials. "It looked easy enough and I decided to give it a try."
Toys 'R Us, it turns out, was running a promotional contest in which customers who purchased the game could win cash prizes.
Jackson's $1,000 prize is the second biggest win in the history of the contest.

According to Jackson, she and her husband had just celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary and were planning to use the winnings to pay for a trip to Las Vegas.
"We may still go to Vegas, but now we can do it a little bit better," she said.
When asked if she would continue to play the game, Jackson said she wasn't sure.
"I don't know if I want to keep playing and risk losing this money," she said. "But I might give it another try."
After all, it only took her one try to win big.

#  Police break up monopoly boardwalk bingo game for being too rowdy 

The Asbury Park police department was called to break up a raucous game of monopoly boardwalk bingo on Saturday night.

Officers arrived to find a group of about 20 people playing the game in an alley near the boardwalk. The players were reportedly shouting and swearing at each other, and several bottles of alcohol were observed in the vicinity.

Police ordered the players to disperse, and several arrests were made when some of them refused to leave.

“This was a serious case of public drunkenness and disorderly conduct,” said Asbury Park Police Chief David Scrivo. “We will not tolerate this kind of behavior in our city.”

Chief Scrivo urged residents to enjoy themselves responsibly during the summertime, and said that any further incidents like this would be met with swift and severe punishment.

#  Man wins luxury vacation playing monopoly boardwalk bingo 

For 23-year-old Florida State University senior, Mitchell Lloyd, vacationing in Miami this week was a game of chance. After winning a free night’s stay at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach Resort and Casino from playing Monopoly Boardwalk Bingo, Lloyd and his girlfriend hit the sunny beaches and high-end shops.

Lloyd says he had no idea what bingo was before playing the game for the resort prize. “I just kind of went with the flow and put all my markers in one spot. I was shocked when they called my number,” said Lloyd of his game-winning strategy.

The Fontainebleau is no slouch in the luxury category, boasting rooms starting at $399 per night. The resort is also one of only a few Miami properties to offer direct beach access.

When asked if he would recommend others try their luck at Boardwalk Bingo, Lloyd said, “It can’t hurt to try! And who knows, maybe you could be next to win a free trip to one of Miami’s most luxurious resorts.”

#  Play monopoly boardwalk bingo for a chance to win a car

Do you love the classic board game Monopoly? How would you like a chance to win a car playing it? Now, you can play Monopoly Boardwalk Bingo for a chance to win a car.

All you need is a deck of regular cards and this printable game board. Cut out the game board and place it in the middle of the table. Shuffle the cards and deal seven cards to each player, face down. The rest of the cards are placed face down in the middle of the table as the draw pile.

The player with the most money at the end of the game wins a car.

To play, first draw a card from the draw pile and place it in the middle of the table. This is your bingo ball. The player to your left starts by flipping over their first card. If they have any of the same symbols as your bingo ball, they place a chip on that space. If they don’t have any of the symbols on their card, they flip over another card and continue until they find one or until they run out of cards.

When they find one, they yell “Bingo!” and grab another card from the deck to start again. The next player then flips over their first card and so on. If at any time you get four in a row (diagonally, vertically or horizontally), yell “Bingo!”and take all of the chips from those spaces.

The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!
