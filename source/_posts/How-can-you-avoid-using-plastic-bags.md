#  How can you avoid using plastic bags?

When it comes to reducing your environmental impact, using fewer plastic bags is low hanging fruit. Plastic bags are one of the most common pieces of litter, and they can take centuries to decompose in landfills.

There are several ways you can avoid using them:

* Bring a reusable bag with you when you go shopping. There are many attractive and sturdy options available now, including canvas and cloth bags, as well as recycled paper and plastic bags.

* If you do need a disposable bag, ask for a paper bag instead of a plastic one.

* Reuse plastic bags as trash can liners or for other tasks around the house.

* Bring your own container when you get take-out or eat at a restaurant. Many places are happy to package your leftovers in a reusable container.

* Avoid products that come packaged in plastic bags, such as fruits and vegetables.

#  What are some ways to avoid using plastic wrap?

When looking for alternatives to plastic wrap, people often turn to aluminum foil, wax paper, and parchment paper. Each of these options has its own benefits and drawbacks.

Aluminum foil is a great way to keep food from sticking to pans and is also effective at trapping moisture and heat. However, it can be a little tricky to use because it’s easy to rip or puncture. Additionally, aluminum foil can react with some foods, so it’s best not to use it for things like leftovers that will be stored in the fridge.

Wax paper is another good option for keeping food from sticking and also prevents it from drying out. It’s non-stick and doesn’t tear easily, but it can be difficult to fold or crimp shut. Wax paper can also leave a residue on food, so it’s not ideal for everything.

Parchment paper is similar to wax paper but doesn’t have the same disadvantages. It’s non-stick and doesn’t affect the taste of food. Parchment paper is also heat resistant and can be used in the oven or microwave.

#  How can you reduce your use of plastic straws?

There are many ways that you can reduce your use of plastic straws. One way is to simply say "no thank you" when a straw is offered to you. If you are ordering a drink at a restaurant or bar, ask for it without a straw. If you must use a straw, request a paper or bamboo straw instead of a plastic straw. You can also buy reusable straws made from stainless steel, glass, or silicone.

#  Why should we avoid using disposable plastics?

It is estimated that 8 million metric tons of plastic end up in the world’s oceans every year. That’s the equivalent of a garbage truck full of plastic waste going into the ocean every minute.

Microplastics, tiny pieces of plastic less than 5 mm in size, are particularly harmful to marine life and the environment. They can be ingested by marine animals and enter the food chain, where they may be consumed by humans.

The majority of disposable plastics are not recyclable and end up in landfill, where they take hundreds of years to biodegrade.

Here are some alternatives to disposable plastics:

Bring your own reusable shopping bag to the store.

Use a refillable water bottle instead of bottled water.

 Carry a cutlery set with you instead of using disposable cutlery.

Use a cloth napkin instead of a paper napkin.

Bring your own container for leftovers when dining out.

#  Are there any other ways that we can avoid using plastics?

Yes, there are a few other ways that we can avoid using plastics. One way is to not buy products that come in plastic packaging. There are a lot of products out there that come in cardboard or paper packaging, so try to buy those products instead of the ones that come in plastic packaging. Another way to avoid using plastics is to bring your own reusable bags with you when you go grocery shopping. A lot of stores now offer discounts for customers who bring their own reusable bags, so it’s a great way to save money and help the environment. Finally, you can also try to avoid using disposable items such as cups, plates, silverware, and straws. There are a lot of reusable alternatives available, so try to use those instead of disposable items.
