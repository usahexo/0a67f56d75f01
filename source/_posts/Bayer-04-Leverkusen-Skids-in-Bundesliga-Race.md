#  Bayer 04 Leverkusen Skids in Bundesliga Race

Bayer 04 Leverkusen's Bundesliga campaign has gone from bad to worse, with the club now third from bottom in the standings.

The Werkself's latest setback came in the form of a 3-2 home defeat against Mainz 05 on Friday evening. Jhon Cordoba, Daniel Brosinski and Pablo De Blasis were all on target for the visitors, while Kevin Volland and Julian Brandt netted for Bayer.

Leverkusen were reduced to 10 men in the second half when Tin Jedvaj was sent off for violent conduct, but they couldn't find an equaliser.

That result means that Roger Schmidt's side have now lost four of their last five Bundesliga matches, taking just two points from a possible 15 in the process.

The poor form means Leverkusen are now just two points above the relegation zone and three clear of last-placed Darmstadt 98.

#  Pressure Mounts on Roger Schmidt After Bayer 04 Leverkusen Skid

Roger Schmidt is coming under increasing pressure at Bayer 04 Leverkusen after a run of poor results culminated in a 2-1 home defeat to relegation strugglers FC Ingolstadt 04 on Matchday 26.

The former Red Bull Salzburg head coach has now overseen four losses in the last six matches in all competitions, leaving the Werkself in fifth place in the Bundesliga and 10 points behind leaders FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen.

With Champions League qualification looking increasingly unlikely, some fans are already calling for Schmidt to be replaced, despite him only being contracted until 2018.

Since taking over at Leverkusen in the summer of 2014, Schmidt has impressed with his high-pressing style of football, but his team have struggled to maintain their form throughout the season.

Last year they finished third in the Bundesliga but this season they are currently well off the pace set by Bayern and Borussia Dortmund.

Schmidt could point to injuries to key players as a reason for his side's dip in form, but many supporters feel that a change is needed if Leverkusen are to compete for silverware next season.

#  Disastrous Start for Bayer 04 Leverkusen as They Continue to Slide

Bayer 04 Leverkusen had a disastrous start to their Bundesliga season as they continue to slide down the table.

Manager Heiko Herrlich was sacked after their sixth consecutive game without a win in all competitions. They currently sit in 12th place in the Bundesliga with just five points from their first seven games.

Their biggest concern is their lack of scoring, as they have only scored six goals in those seven games. Former Hoffenheim manager Julian Nagelsmann has been appointed as their new manager and he will be looking to turnaround their fortunes quickly.

Leverkusen were knocked out of the Champions League in the group stages, and then were eliminated from the German Cup in the second round. They will now be looking to make a run at qualifying for Europa League next season.

#  Schmidt Fighting for His Job as Bayer 04 Leverkusen Continue Their Slippery Path

After a poor start to the season, which sees them in 13th place in the Bundesliga table, Bayer 04 Leverkusen head coach Roger Schmidt is fighting for his job. The club's Managing Director, Michael Schade, has made it clear that the coach is not exempt from the club's poor form, and that he could be replaced if things do not improve.

Bayer 04 have only won two of their first eight Bundesliga games this season, and have already been eliminated from the Champions League. Their poor performances have led to fans protesting against Schmidt and the club's board.

The team's latest defeat came on Sunday, when they lost 2-1 at home to Mainz 05. This result left them just four points above the relegation zone. Schmidt said after the game that he takes full responsibility for the team's poor form, but he may not be around much longer if things do not improve soon.

#  Bayer 04 Leverkusen Can't Catch a Break as They Slip Further and Further

Bayer 04 Leverkusen are slipping further and further in the Bundesliga standings, as they can't seem to catch a break.

The first big issue for the team was the long-term injury to winger Leon Bailey, who has been out since January. His absence has been sorely felt, as the club have only scored 29 goals in 24 matches since he went down.

Another key player who has been missing is midfielder Kai Havertz. The 20-year-old missed six weeks earlier in the season with an ankle injury, and he has not looked quite himself since returning.

Injuries certainly haven't been the only problem for Leverkusen, as they have also had trouble scoring goals. They currently sit in 13th place in the Bundesliga with only 32 goals scored, which is only two more than last-place Hannover 96.

One of their biggest problems has been their inability to win away from home. Bayer 04 Leverkusen have won just two of their 10 road games this season, which is tied for second-worst in the league.

Their last match was a 2-1 loss at home to newly promoted Fortuna Dusseldorf. It was a very frustrating loss, as they dominated possession (61%) and had more shots on goal (14-5). However, they were unable to find the back of the net, and Dusseldorf took advantage of some poor defending to get the win.

The result leaves Bayer 04 Leverkusen in 12th place in the Bundesliga table, just two points above the relegation playoff spot. They will need to start picking up wins if they want to stay up this season.
