#  Is there a Mark Twain museum in Sevilla FC? 

Mark Twain was born on November 30, 1835 in Florida, Missouri. He was an American author and humorist. Some of his famous works include "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" and "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn".

Twain passed away on April 21, 1910. However, that hasn't stopped his legacy from living on. In fact, there's even a Mark Twain museum in Hannibal, Missouri - the birthplace of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.

But what about Sevilla FC? Is there a Mark Twain museum in Spain's most successful football club?

As it turns out, there isn't a Mark Twain museum in Sevilla FC. However, that doesn't mean that the club isn't connected to the author in some way. In fact, there's a statue of Twain inside the Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.

The statue was unveiled on September 19, 2009 as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations. It features Twain sitting on a bench with a book open in his lap. The inscription reads: "There is but one world and laughter is its key."

So why did Sevilla FC choose to honor Mark Twain? According to then-president Jose Maria del Nido, "Twain is one of the great writers in history and one of the most universal."

Del Nido also said that Twain was an inspiration to him and that he hoped the statue would make people think about the importance of laughter.

And that seems to be what Twain himself would have wanted. As he once wrote: "Laughter is the great cure-all."
